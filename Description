Title:
Pest Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Description:
This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically classify images of pests into different categories. The pipeline consists of several key components:

Data Preparation:

Dataset: The dataset comprises images of pests stored in a directory. The images are divided into training and validation sets using an ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation and rescaling.
Image Augmentation: To improve the model's performance and generalization, techniques like shear, zoom, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images.
Model Building:

Architecture: The model is built using Keras' Sequential API with multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers. The architecture includes:
Three Convolutional layers (Conv2D) to extract features from images.
Three Max-Pooling layers (MaxPooling2D) to reduce the spatial dimensions.
A Flatten layer to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
Dense layers for classification, with dropout used to prevent overfitting.
Compilation: The model uses categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
Training:

The model is trained for 50 epochs with training and validation data generators. The performance metrics (accuracy) are monitored throughout the training process.
Evaluation and Prediction:

Model Saving and Loading: After training, the model is saved to a file for future use. It can be loaded to make predictions on new images.
Image Prediction: A function predict_image is defined to process and classify new images. It preprocesses the image, runs it through the model, and outputs the predicted class.
Example Usage:

The project includes an example of predicting the class of a new pest image using the trained model. The prediction results are printed, showing which pest category the image belongs to.
This project demonstrates the practical application of CNNs for image classification tasks and can be extended to various pest detection and management scenarios.
